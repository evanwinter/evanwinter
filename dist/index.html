				<h1>Evan Winter is a front-end engineer based in Chicago, Illinois.</h1>
				<p>
					I write software for the web and make it look nice.
				</p>
				<p>
					I’m experienced with a variety of technologies and stacks, but my favorite tools to work with are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – especially in their more modern flavors.
				</p>
				<p>
					I’m currently a junior Software Engineer at advertising agency Schafer Condon Carter, where I work on the UX and front-end development of websites and web apps.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some things I’m exploring in my free time include data visualization, natural language processing, progressive web apps and design systems.
